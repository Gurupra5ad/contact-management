30 DAY Challenge - DAY 9

As a part of day 9 challenge in my 30 days = 30 projects challenge, I am going to develop a console-based contact management system that allows users to enter and retrieve contact details, and delete existing contacts.

In this project instead of just stroing it in a list, i am going to create a database where these data will be stored and can be used whenever wanted. 

This project might be in future can be developed with a GUI.

30 DAY Challenge - DAY 7

As a part of day 7 challenge in my 30 days = 30 projects challenge, I am going to develop a console-based book store system that allows users to enter and retrieve book details, as well as mark books as read (meaning theyâ€™ve finished reading them already), and
delete existing books.

In this project instead of just stroing it in a list, i am going to create a database where these data will be stored and can be used whenever wanted. 

This project might be in future can be developed with a GUI and machine learning algorithms to have recomendation system for the books.
